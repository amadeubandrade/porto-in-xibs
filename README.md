# more-about-porto
This is one of the apps made in Udemy's iOS course "iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional". 
I used this app to create the interface without storyboards, applying what I learned about using XIB files.
Used size classes and stack views for the layout; Added a navigation controller programatically and the possibility to hide when touched; Added the possibility to swipe when in Photos view.
